# WandOfDiscord
A bot that lets you play NetHack, the classic roguelike, over Discord! Set up the bot, get it running, and play! You can either use the bot in a server by yourself, or play with multiple people at the same time in a server with friends!


## How do I run this?

As of now, you'll need to go into the bot file and replace the following two lines

- Replace the `playername = "Your_Name_Here"` line with your name
- Replace the `bot.run("TOKEN")` line with your token

You will also need Python 3 with the modules pexpect, inspect, traceback, discord.py, and asyncio, and of course, you will need NetHack.

## What OSes does this run under?

I have only tested it on Linux.
