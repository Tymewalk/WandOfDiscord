# WandOfDiscord
A bot that lets you play NetHack, the classic roguelike, over Discord! Set up the bot, get it running, and play! You can either use the bot in a server by yourself, or play with multiple people at the same time in a server with friends!


## How do I run this?

Run the `config.py` script and add your bot's token and the name of your player there.

You will also need Python 3.5+ with the modules pexpect, inspect, traceback, discord.py, and asyncio, and of course, you will need NetHack.

## What OSes does this run under?

I have only tested it on Linux.

## Hey, the bot is broken! / A feature is missing!

Leave me an issue. This is currently not the best code and definitely needs some improvement. However, I wanted to upload it because I finally got it working, and nothing like this existed before.
