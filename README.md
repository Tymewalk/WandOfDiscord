# WandOfDiscord
A bot that lets you play NetHack, the classic roguelike, over Discord!


## How do I run this?

As of now, you'll need to go into the bot file and replace the following two lines

- Replace the `name = "Your_Name_Here"` line with your name
- Replace the `TOKEN` line with your token

You will also need Python 3 with the modules pexpect, inspect, traceback, discord.py, and asyncio.
